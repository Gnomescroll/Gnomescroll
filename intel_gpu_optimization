Use threading

GMA 935, 3150 does vertex processing on CPU

Use triangles instead of quads?
Use strips

-avoid weird texture formats

!!! remove exp/log and exponential functions from compatability

"the Intel® VTune ™ Performance Analyzer is the perfect tool."

!!! Must be fullscreen to avoid context switching !!!

!!!
* Cull backfaces. This is done per-chunk, so it has to be very forgiving, but it cuts out about 40% of all terrain quads. It works by dividing each chunk into six display lists, one per face, and only rendering the lists that are facing the player.

!!!
* Join adjacent strips of the same texture. If there's a rock next to a rock, why render two quads? Well, because I use a texture atlas, that's why. But by turning the atlas from a 16x16 grid to a 1x256 grid, I can repeat along u to make strips of the same texture. On a newly generated map, the average strip length is just over 2 tiles, so this cuts out 50% of all quads.

!!!
Reduce map generation/change time

!!! Visibility flags for block sides

256 bits per column?
Keep only blocks with sides exposed
