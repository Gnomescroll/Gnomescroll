== PVE ==
blue bombs should be wandering, slowly
blue bombs lose target if target dies
blue bombs should lose target after N ticks

red bots should have a small random tick delay (0-5 maybe) between acquiring agent as a target and firing
this will let players "dodge"

some boxes arent getting destination correctly -- just jumping around with state updates
--especially when cross boundaries

== GFX ==
glsl colored/textured voxels
cap number of animation particles created in a single frame
texture color problem in OSX -- for blocks and for items
Hud Weapon sprites + animation
use font DST_COLOR only for certain ui elements

== SOUND ==
improve digging sounds
mining laser whoosh

== MAINTENANCE/REFACTORS ==
switch item's container_id,slot & particle_id to an enum (HAND,CONTAINER,PARTICLE) and context-dependent id

== UI/UX ==
indicate where something can be placed
--particularly, feeding the nanite
<Kaprekar> ahhh, pressing alt+space causes you to jump and move in one direction constantly until you alt-tab out
-- windows only?
alt tab doesnt work in fullscreen
--attempt to do best alt-tab again? (the issue before was with how it regrabbed focus -- the event for mouse passing over window was the same as alt-tabbing back to the window)
version mismatch popup for OS X
hud disable key in production build

== CONTAINERS ==
smelter
if item can stack in the inventory, do that before going in toolbelt
right click throw throws 1
am able to open inventory when dead, but not close it

== ITEMS ==

== ANALYTICS ==
Record time played per user

== MAP ==
Put some methane underground
Regenerate methane blocks somehow

==BUGZ==
item does not exist on destruction msgs
--add better warning
