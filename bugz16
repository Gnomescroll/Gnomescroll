blue bombs should aggro if shot
blue bombs should be wandering, slowly
blue bombs should damage terrain like grenades

red bots should have a small random tick delay (0-5 maybe) between acquiring agent as a target and firing
this will let players "dodge"

<Kaprekar> ahhh, pressing alt+space causes you to jump and move in one direction constantly until you alt-tab out
-- windows only?
have chat display a "Press U to relock mouse" when window gains focus and mouse is unlocked
alt tab doesnt work in fullscreen
--attempt to do best alt-tab again? (the issue before was with how it regrabbed focus -- the event for mouse passing over window was the same as alt-tabbing back to the window)

Normal, but need to add both max and starting health to packet?
--Since packets are ordered, look into sending a minimal create then a state packet right after

some container cant be opened

container window doesnt close when active container gets destroyed
