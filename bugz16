item eater:
"halve a stack, place it where another stack of a different item is, place in the same spot, move the stack that was halved anywhere, the replaced stack disappears"
FIXED !!! (needed to call container_remove in full hand swap to get the item's  container_id/slot references updated)

<Kaprekar> i don't think blocks are stacking properly. i opened my inventory and had about 4 stacks of varying sizes of the same item type after mining away for a while

DONE

blue bombs should aggro if shot
blue bombs should be wandering, slowly
blue bombs should damage terrain like grenades

red bots should have a small random tick delay (0-5 maybe) between acquiring agent as a target and firing
this will let players "dodge"

<Kaprekar> ahhh, pressing alt+space causes you to jump and move in one direction constantly until you alt-tab out
-- windows only?
have chat display a "Press U to relock mouse" when window gains focus and mouse is unlocked
alt tab doesnt work in fullscreen
--attempt to do best alt-tab again? (the issue before was with how it regrabbed focus -- the event for mouse passing over window was the same as alt-tabbing back to the window)

tiling noise [BRANDON]

glsl colored/textured voxels

shovel sounds
block placement sounds

remove 2nd ping number

red box random walk is biased to +/+
