networked & ui predicted block damage, rendering damage overlay & fade out

blue bombs wander -- experiment with new state machine style

----------------------

== BUILD ==
REMINDER:
    Update the download link on gamejolt.com every build
Script to pack all builds into one zip

== PVE ==

red bots should have a small random tick delay (0-5 maybe) between acquiring agent as a target and firing
this will let players "dodge"

some boxes arent getting destination correctly -- just jumping around with state updates
--especially when cross boundaries

ankle biter mobs

== GFX ==
glsl colored/textured voxels, fix normal lighting
Improve Hud Weapon sprites animations
textured voxels / isometric blocks should use full palette info, instead of only one side
better font
melee on agents should draw blood -- does it already? (make sure it does for you->others and others->others)
voxel model rgb rolls over to 0 for 255 (e.g. 255,255,254 => 0,0,254), somewhere (by the time its rendered)
draw stack number with billboard item

== SOUND ==
improve digging sounds
falling sounds
    -- record last velocity when colliding with z. at 2 thresholds play harsher sounds

create more sfx with gargoyle2, add for simple actions

== MAINTENANCE/REFACTORS ==
png write does not work in 64bit binary

elastic component lists

craft/smelting recipes need reagents sorted by stack size in addition to type -- currently only by type
    -- is not a problem until multiple of the same type have different stack sizes
    -- assert in dat loader checks for this
    
something is messed up with box models. client reports get_center() as even higher above its head, in the object_shot_object packet handler
position looks normal though, as a firing position

animation level options
0,1,2,3,4
0 - None
1 - Low counts, no rotations
2 - Medium counts, no rotations on anim vox partciels
4 - Full, rotations

Linearize mouse sensitivity

== CONTROLS/INPUT ==
<Kaprekar> ahhh, pressing alt+space causes you to jump and move in one direction constantly until you alt-tab out
-- windows only?
alt tab doesnt work in fullscreen (on linux at least)
--attempt to do best alt-tab again? (the issue before was with how it regrabbed focus -- the event for mouse passing over window was the same as alt-tabbing back to the window)

== SMELTER ==
palette for smelter on/off

== ITEMS ==
Binoculars

== CRAFTING / RECIPES ==

== BLOCKS/TERRAIN ==

== ANALYTICS ==

== UI/UX ==
graphical indicator for block damage (meter, voxel texture overlay etc)

== GENERAL ==
option to hide name

maintain a NetClient buffer per stage of ready-ness
broadcast only to clients who are are in fully ready

***Autoupdater***

Breakpad crash report integration

draw outline of object to be placed

== MECHANISMS ==
Spawner/Control Points
    -- User builds them like the old spawners
    -- Requires:
        Craft path
        Entity modifications
        
All control points draw png border around them.
Control point colors all cubes in radius a certain hue, for player's own 
control point.

Inside control zone, nobody except player can:
Add block
Damage/remove block
Open chests
Destroy the control point

Any player can choose to use the control point as their spawn zone.
When the player creates his control point he is automatically assigned to it. [change this once players are familiar with the mechanism / we have better UI feedback?]
The player right-clicks to set his control point spawner.
On the map, B is drawn where his spawner is assigned.

The starting base is an unowned control point. Nobody can own this.

A player can destroy the control point he owns.  The control point drops
a control point when destroyed.  The color tint must be reset, and the border must not draw.

Q: Should control points be another block type, or should it be a model?
A: we can make it 1x1 but treat it as an object/model. it will render at its location
    as a block, it will be set to invisible so no texture is rendered.
    Solid must also be false, so hitscan can pass through.

Spawner / Control Node / Energy Core
 
==BUGZ==
might be bug with entity system object ids or something

take care of intellisense warnings

change map seed
