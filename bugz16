<Kaprekar> ahhh, pressing alt+space causes you to jump and move in one direction constantly until you alt-tab out
-- windows only?

have chat display a "Press U to relock mouse" when window gains focus and mouse is unlocked
--attempt to do best alt-tab again? (the issue before was with how it regrabbed focus -- the event for mouse passing over window was the same as alt-tabbing back to the window)

alt tab doesnt work in fullscreen
