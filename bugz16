== PVE ==
blue bombs should be wandering, slowly
blue bombs lose target if target dies
blue bombs should lose target after N ticks

red bots should have a small random tick delay (0-5 maybe) between acquiring agent as a target and firing
this will let players "dodge"

some boxes arent getting destination correctly -- just jumping around with state updates
--especially when cross boundaries

== GFX ==
glsl colored/textured voxels
texture color problem in OSX -- for blocks and for items
Hud Weapon sprites + animation

== SOUND ==
improve digging sounds
mining laser whoosh

== MAINTENANCE/REFACTORS ==
parameterize open/close container input handling shit

== UI/UX ==
indicate where something can be placed
<Kaprekar> ahhh, pressing alt+space causes you to jump and move in one direction constantly until you alt-tab out
-- windows only?
have chat display a "Press U to relock mouse" when window gains focus and mouse is unlocked
alt tab doesnt work in fullscreen
--attempt to do best alt-tab again? (the issue before was with how it regrabbed focus -- the event for mouse passing over window was the same as alt-tabbing back to the window)
version mismatch popup for OS X
right click on osx???

== CONTAINERS ETC ==
methane blocks that decay
animation on decay
cryofreezer
smelter
craft bench levels

== ANALYTICS ==
Record time played per user

== MISC ==
Anything that has a z level below -128 should die
Especially particles
