DONE

right side up isometric blocks
DONE

if voxel model gets destroyed to 0 (or maybe a % threshold like 15) just die
--the completely empty function is done. need to integrate it into component system
--agents need more careful restrictions. they can't just die early. maybe N blocks per N damage
--server should keep track of solid voxel counts instead of recalculating constantly

use 64pixel isometric texture
-- texture blit copies pixels directly
--Try: shirnking the 64 texture to 16 after generation. the shitty look is due to the draw_iso_sprite() method, opengl should interpolate better

blue bombs should aggro if shot

blue bombs should be wandering, slowly

destroy 1 voxel in monster spawner
destroy 2 voxels in robot

or just do voxel destruction based on cumulative damage

shovels/fist melee

tiling noise
