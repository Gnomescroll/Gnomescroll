team names
agent names via c

voxel Skeleton loading & updating

============
Jan 25

Hitscan laser using correct camera state
Team scores
Team spawning in area
increase chat message render time
Agent flag captures affect score
Clean up waf exceptions in client
Remove hk stl include
Change xmax,ymax,zmax macros to XMAX,YMAX,ZMAX
Store `actual` map size, transmit to client(s)
fixed hud formatting
help menu
Team name & scores in hud
Add colored fonts for teams
use offset for block selector
grenades/etc drawing
damage indicator particle billboarded properly
agent name on teammates in view
Place block fail if agent collides (client side)

=============
Jan 26

Add Agent_state* to PlayerAgent_state
Correct hud weapon texture positions
Merge CtoS firing packet into firing action
Server side place block fail
Move definitions out of headers
Remove unnecessary id property from packets, get id from implicit client_id
billboard text using font glyph alignment, centering, sizing, etc

=============
Jan 27

Billboard text hud projection
Agent name billboard using hud projection
Agents removed from teams on client disconnect
Investigated input normalization

=============

Jan 28-29 (sleep shifted)
Tuned hitscan laser animation to animate offset from player camera vector
move agent collision detections to agent physics
Cleaned up agent control state code
Crouching
Jumping on ground
camera heights
fix agent kill scorekeeping bug
Team name and colors in hud fixed
Right click should only block select when block selector is active
aligned skeleton
update collision detection to handle jumping/jetpack into the ceiling
Started spawners (creation, networking, weapon for placing them)
Align simple voxel models (slime, base etc)

=============

Jan 29-30

Coins:
coins allocation
get coins for flag capture
added to hud $X

improved base and flag spawn boundaries
increased agent speed

Spawners:
cost coins
team maximum
Cant be placed on other spawners
Send list to new clients
Use to determine agent spawn point
Can't be placed where current spawner is
Base acts as defacto spawner.
Health/Destruction
Spawner is reassigned if destroyed since last spawn

List filters on Object_list template
Grenades damage spawners (and turrets when ready)

Add simple gravity to items
merge hitscan object packets

use map dimensions for minimap; raster for heightmap data to get rid of lag spike
Teammates on hud map
Move cube dat client side. not networked

sphere fulstrum culling using radius

fix object_list template index bug (last element overwrite)
add null checks to *list.create where missing
zero control state if dead (agent wont continue walking after death)
Bundle object list transmission into one C method, for new agent connects (cut client compile by >10secs)
remove c_lib_monsters
only use constant server seed during map gen -- use time() for the rest (base/flag/etc spawning)
merge cython files (compile time down to ~7secs both server and client)

=============

Jan 30-31

Add deucbag flag vox
"You're dead" notification



=============

bleed from damage
other agent bleed if think they took damage (got shot)
spray blood in proper direction

Find the glColor bug: minivox coloring

make the flag spin

Chat cursor in C

Fix collision detection

OpenAL ?

Icons on map (angus)

Client side jump physics (server is snapping)

Turrets

Minimap

Sounds
System notifications (you killed...)

Voxel editor:
Bucket fill
Rewrite deserializer
Color pallete
Color wheel --contingent on js lib
http://design.geckotribe.com/colorwheel/    (shows complementary colors)
http://jscolor.com/ (has saturation slider)

Sort out converter pipeline. Fix off by one dimension bug translating from slab6vox ->v3a->json->dcvox

Deprecate python packets
-- Identify/fail
-- Chat messages
-- Chunk list, chunk
::Identifies rely on python client pool for name management; pointless to move
until then. loss of name collision functionality not worht it::
::Chat messages outgoing can be in C but incoming would still need to be in python,
without excess struggling::
::Chunk list, chunk are being moved to C with terrain map rewrite::

SDL input normalization
--There is no real solution. Might be able to use scancodes to handle most cases. Keymapping feature is only real solution




PYTHON DEPRECATION:
Chat
Identify/Chat packets
NetServer pool -- name pool
Hud
Font loading (can stay cython til the end -- save all parsers for last if possible)
Input (lambdas, block applier)
Camera
Main loop

unknown:
stats, profiler

Leave:
settings.py
Parsers
map gen scripts (can be removed easy, not integrated)
