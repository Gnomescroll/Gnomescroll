Deprecate python packets
-- Identify/fail
-- Cube dat
-- Chat messages
-- Chunk list, chunk

Investigate if object lists w/ auto id are creating 1 past end of the array
Fix collision detection
Client side jump physics (server is snapping)

Every 13 connect or so, fails with "no agent". investigate
SDL input normalization
--There is no real solution. Might be able to use scancodes to handle most cases. Keymapping feature is only real solution

Turrets

Minimap

"You're dead" notification. Halt all motion

Bundle object list transmission into one, for new agent connects

Sounds
OpenAL ?
System notifications (you killed...)
