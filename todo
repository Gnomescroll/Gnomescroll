move agent collision detections to agent physics
Cleaned up agent control state code
Crouching
Jumping on ground
camera heights

=============

Jan 29-30

Coins:
coins allocation
get coins for flag capture
added to hud $X

improved base and flag spawn boundaries
increased agent speed

Spawners:
cost coins
team maximum
Cant be placed on other spawners
Send list to new clients
Use to determine agent spawn point
Can't be placed where current spawner is
Base acts as defacto spawner.
Health/Destruction
Spawner is reassigned if destroyed since last spawn

List filters on Object_list template
Grenades damage spawners (and turrets when ready)

Add simple gravity to items
merge hitscan object packets

use map dimensions for minimap; raster for heightmap data to get rid of lag spike
Teammates on hud map
Move cube dat client side. not networked

sphere fulstrum culling using radius

fix object_list template index bug (last element overwrite)
add null checks to *list.create where missing
zero control state if dead (agent wont continue walking after death)
Bundle object list transmission into one C method, for new agent connects (cut client compile by >10secs)
remove c_lib_monsters
only use constant server seed during map gen -- use time() for the rest (base/flag/etc spawning)
merge cython files (compile time down to ~7secs both server and client)

=============

Jan 30-31

Add deucbag flag vox
"You're dead" notification
make the flag spin
Fixed colored minivox affecting textured minivox

removed fire_weapon_StoC, replaced with target (object, block, nothing) dependent packets
thus multiplayer gun animations

proper sound failure handling
fix sound positions
better attenuation settings

fix hitscan laser bug when teammates in view
fix team killing /suicides bug

bleed from damage
other agent bleed if think they took damage (got shot)

Chat cursor in C
scoreboard zoom handling

grenades kill slimes
load all projection matrices in camera, once
agent respawn with correct orientation (team based)
fixed minivox coloring
blood spray in random biased direction of incident laser

=============

Feb 1

Melee attack w/ pick
Double buffered map textures
Synchronize PLAYERS_MAX across agent_list, netlib, game/teams (#define PLAYERS_MAX 64 in c_lib/defines.h)
Fix collision detection

reticle in C
cube selector in C
fix cube selector input
inventory in C
hud draw settings in C
=============

OpenAL ?

Icons on map (angus)

Client side jump physics (server is snapping)

Turrets

Minimap

Sounds
System notifications (you killed...)

Voxel editor:
Bucket fill
Rewrite deserializer
Color pallete
Color wheel --contingent on js lib
http://design.geckotribe.com/colorwheel/    (shows complementary colors)
http://jscolor.com/ (has saturation slider)

Sort out converter pipeline. Fix off by one dimension bug translating from slab6vox ->v3a->json->dcvox

SDL input normalization
--There is no real solution. Might be able to use scancodes to handle most cases. Keymapping feature is only real solution

Figure out the long term server crash

Deprecate python packets
-- Identify/fail
-- Chat messages
-- Chunk list, chunk
::Identifies rely on python client pool for name management; pointless to move
until then. loss of name collision functionality not worht it::
::Chat messages outgoing can be in C but incoming would still need to be in python,
without excess struggling::
::Chunk list, chunk are being moved to C with terrain map rewrite::

PYTHON DEPRECATION:
ORDER:
HUD
Input
NetServer pool
Chat
Camera
Font
Main loop

Leave:
settings.py
Parsers
map gen scripts (can be removed easy, not integrated)

delete the rest
