make better particle class to abstract some drawing
ParticleSystem class for doing much cheaper view distance checks

==================
POLISH TODO:

figure out interface for spawner selection from map icons
rotate head

GRENADES:
charge up
-- for better grenade blast cover simulation, can emit a handful of small particles (like the animation, but more and a little bit higher ttl) and if they collide with an agent then it hits
-- this will get some blasts around corners. still, cap the radial distance for these particles. also possibly decrease damage by particle travel distance

make "YOURE DEAD" larger

Bug: agent_id unrecognized. happens in the object list
Bug: very nasty -- invalid read/write at different points in the voxel render list unregister. may be related to uninitialised fulstrum test variable that sometimes appears.
        gdb resisted watchpoints
        
territory control
    -- color in GLSL

better feedback on damage received

player name sanitization
-- limited punctuation? (clans like to use it)
-- no spaces or \t or \n  (maybe spaces in the middle of text but not at ends)
-- not all spaces

better damage on character models (radius instead of single voxel)

fix bug in dcvox pipeline where dimensions are incorrect
-- sort out pipeline
-- move dimensions to inferred by parser?

private properties of packets, use explicit data filling (but not a constructor, no need to hit the heap)
