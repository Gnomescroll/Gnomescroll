Control data per player can take less than 32 bits

id 8 bits
x-angle 8 bits
control - 8 bits
y-angle 4 bits
?seq 4 bits

at 30/second, takes 120 bytes/second per client

Two Approaches:
-send clients control state sequence, with occational state uploads
-send frequent state updates

With control state, client side and server side prediction are same.  Requires replay of simulation.
