Packets:
-messages go into pool
-function for adding/removing messages from out_pool
-are sorted by priority
-have callback functions

-get_message callback (char*)
-message_acked callback
-message failed callback

packet registers callbacks

Types of generic messages:
	-event (soonest, unreliable); bullet
	-state (reliable); weapon change, etc retransmit until acked
	-state (latest only); position, aiming direction

Control data per player can take less than 32 bits

id 8 bits
x-angle 8 bits
control - 8 bits
y-angle 4 bits
?seq 4 bits

at 30/second, takes 120 bytes/second per client

Two Approaches:
-send clients control state sequence, with occational state uploads
-send frequent state updates

With control state, client side and server side prediction are same.  Requires replay of simulation.
