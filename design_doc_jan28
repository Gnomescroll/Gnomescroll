Turrets, Spawners

Points system for buying spawner/turrents

Max spawners/turrets per team

Team coop incentives:

Teammates can return players' items
Points are  allocated for this
Items are dropped on death
-- As a bundle or as individual items


Points can be allocated for destroying turrets/spawners if the incentive is needed
(The incentive is implicit as it is, probably not needed)
(Regular 'points' can be given for these)

Spawners:

Spawners are an item like base/flag etc
(vox model, single point)

Choose spawner menu (like choose team, weapon)
Brings up surface map over all/most of screen
Spawner location icons are displayed on the map
Spawner ID # is displayed on or next to icon (either as hud text or baked into the texture)
Player presses key number to select spawner
Alternative/complementary controls:
    Current selected spawner is highlighted icon
    Player uses arrow keys to cycle selected
    Presses ENTER to choose spawner
Player will continue to spawn at chosen spawner until spawner is destroyed
If spawner is destroyed, game automatically reassigns spawner
On player connect, random spawner is chosen
(If player never selects a spawner, do they get a random one each spawn, or does it stick with the first randomly chosen one?)


Turrets:
Turrets are placed on the face of block
Its LOS it determined from this
TODO:
    Calibrate fire rate, range, damage

If turrets are destroyed too easily from afar, make them immune/resistant to laser
