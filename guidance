<GeneralE> HaltingState that looks like minecraft
<GeneralE> add dinosaurs
<USABxPXYC> 3D Dino-run, I'm guessing, GeneralE?
<HaltingState> GeneralE, someone else can add dinosours or if they voxel them, i will add them
<HaltingState> what are those little dinosaurs that attack people and that reddit likes? velociraptors or something, we need thsoe
<Nach0z> lol HaltingState 
<Nach0z> I can totally see that. the first AoS AI is a VELOCIRAPTOR. nom nom nom.

<Triplefox> productive game design is all about finding the mindset of what matters
<Triplefox> and the things that are visible to the player are what matter the most at first

>The principal element of this game , destroyed.
I've seen that , after the last updates , like .58 .60 and .62 that people don't even build anymore , this is awful , since the main thing that makes this game different from the generic shooter genre is the building aspect.
Since people aren't building , it will probably make this game kinda boring.
I build , but i remember back around in .42 to .50 when i joined , i built a trench in the Mat server , the map was Normandie , i remember , that map was a hit , every server had it.I built that trench, then 8 people joined me and we build a fortress that helped my team to cap the intel.

I find there to be a few different crowds in MC. There are the horders (completionists), once they've discoverd everything and have everything in their inventory they grow bored of the game. Then there are the "Spikes" (borrowing this term from Magic the Gathering). They are the people that are get the full sets of diamond armor, weapons and tools all with lvl 50 enchants...and the world becomes boring because there is no challenge to them.  Then there's the builders, the creators. They don't become bored becuase their folly is unlimited. These people don't have stacked inventories full of powerful items becuase they chose to use them rather than just keeping them in chests to look at.  Then there's the Redstone crowd. I haven't got there yet but I envy them. They really seem to be getting the most out of the game.

Sense of loss:
-"I know that feel. It was today, actually, as I commuted across several hundred blocks of nether to get from my portal to my apothecary, while feeling absolutely no fear or sense of danger, I realized that I wasn't playing the same game as when I started playing minecraft."

<HaltingState> mat^2, in AoS when I move, the movement is not instantaneous and player accelerates upto walk speed; is the "accelerator" actually acceleration to walk velocity or is it from interpolating player position?

<bcoolface> yeah the acceleration is constant, but friction limits you to a velocity
<bcoolface> friction is less in air, higher in water
<bcoolface> linear against velocity
<bcoolface> brb tf2
