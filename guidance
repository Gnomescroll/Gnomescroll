<Triplefox> productive game design is all about finding the mindset of what matters
<Triplefox> and the things that are visible to the player are what matter the most at first

>The principal element of this game , destroyed.
I've seen that , after the last updates , like .58 .60 and .62 that people don't even build anymore , this is awful , since the main thing that makes this game different from the generic shooter genre is the building aspect.
Since people aren't building , it will probably make this game kinda boring.
I build , but i remember back around in .42 to .50 when i joined , i built a trench in the Mat server , the map was Normandie , i remember , that map was a hit , every server had it.I built that trench, then 8 people joined me and we build a fortress that helped my team to cap the intel.

<HaltingState> mat^2, in AoS when I move, the movement is not instantaneous and player accelerates upto walk speed; is the "accelerator" actually acceleration to walk velocity or is it from interpolating player position?

<bcoolface> yeah the acceleration is constant, but friction limits you to a velocity
<bcoolface> friction is less in air, higher in water
<bcoolface> linear against velocity
