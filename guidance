But gameplay is still king
Bad graphics = ugly game
But bad gameplay = nobody plays it

exceptionalism

<Cell> support the 4 types of players
1/4 = The Creative ones, who likes to build stuff.
1/4 = The Destructive ones, who likes to wreck stuff, blow stuff up, wreck other players, wreck enemies, grief.
1/4 = The Mechanism ones, they like to do stuff like Redstone, stuff that makes them unique against the other players, people that likes to mess around; see what happens.
1/4 = The Socialism / Anti Socialism ones, who likes to interact with friends, people, make new friends, or having fun playing alone, wrecking other peoples stuff.
that's what makes minecraft a good *game*
*game* = It has no REAL goal, just CREATIVE or DESTRUCTIVE or MECHANISM or SOCIAL/ANTISOCIAL goals.

"flaw driven development"

Why is Minecraft Fun:
<Kaprekar> you can build, farm, even make fucking cpus, and there are threats to make it challenging. in multiplayer, you can cooperate with people, make villages/towns, whatever, or you can just attack people
<Kaprekar> you can do whatever you want in it

<Triplefox> this may help you decide which players crafting should be catering for http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm

<Hanson So> hahaha! those are cute hahaha
<Azn_Gamer> HaltingState; That is one scary looking crab

Chase_UC> Oh, I thought that Ben was the only one working on AoS...
<mat^2> nope
<Chase_UC> Is there anyone else that works on AoS except you two?
<mat^2> if you mean directly on the source, no
<mat^2> I mostly work on the OpenGL port, though -> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3jPXgsXPVE

On BrickForce
<danhezee> they had a great game plan
<danhezee> no disrespect to ben but his plan is ad hoc and ever changing 

!!! Hate is good. This is because conflict drives the formation of social bonds and thus of communities. It is an engine that brings players closer together.

<GeneralE> HaltingState that looks like minecraft
<GeneralE> add dinosaurs
<USABxPXYC> 3D Dino-run, I'm guessing, GeneralE?
<HaltingState> GeneralE, someone else can add dinosours or if they voxel them, i will add them
<HaltingState> what are those little dinosaurs that attack people and that reddit likes? velociraptors or something, we need thsoe
<Nach0z> lol HaltingState 
<Nach0z> I can totally see that. the first AoS AI is a VELOCIRAPTOR. nom nom nom.

<Triplefox> productive game design is all about finding the mindset of what matters
<Triplefox> and the things that are visible to the player are what matter the most at first

>The principal element of this game , destroyed.
I've seen that , after the last updates , like .58 .60 and .62 that people don't even build anymore , this is awful , since the main thing that makes this game different from the generic shooter genre is the building aspect.
Since people aren't building , it will probably make this game kinda boring.
I build , but i remember back around in .42 to .50 when i joined , i built a trench in the Mat server , the map was Normandie , i remember , that map was a hit , every server had it.I built that trench, then 8 people joined me and we build a fortress that helped my team to cap the intel.

I find there to be a few different crowds in MC. There are the horders (completionists), once they've discoverd everything and have everything in their inventory they grow bored of the game. Then there are the "Spikes" (borrowing this term from Magic the Gathering). They are the people that are get the full sets of diamond armor, weapons and tools all with lvl 50 enchants...and the world becomes boring because there is no challenge to them.  Then there's the builders, the creators. They don't become bored becuase their folly is unlimited. These people don't have stacked inventories full of powerful items becuase they chose to use them rather than just keeping them in chests to look at.  Then there's the Redstone crowd. I haven't got there yet but I envy them. They really seem to be getting the most out of the game.

Sense of loss:
-"I know that feel. It was today, actually, as I commuted across several hundred blocks of nether to get from my portal to my apothecary, while feeling absolutely no fear or sense of danger, I realized that I wasn't playing the same game as when I started playing minecraft."

<HaltingState> mat^2, in AoS when I move, the movement is not instantaneous and player accelerates upto walk speed; is the "accelerator" actually acceleration to walk velocity or is it from interpolating player position?

<bcoolface> yeah the acceleration is constant, but friction limits you to a velocity
<bcoolface> friction is less in air, higher in water
<bcoolface> linear against velocity
<bcoolface> brb tf2
