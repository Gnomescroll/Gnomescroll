Using admin client--

./run.py

Commands:
id :: show client id
ping :: show ping
clear :: clears map (normal clients fail to load properly if started after map cleared)
set x y z val :: sets map block
perlin [val] :: generates perlin noise map, with base tile [val]. Val defaults to 6.


For commands that require a response from the server (e.g. ping), hit enter to move the loop so events can be processed
