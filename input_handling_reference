SDL_VIDEO_X11_MOUSEACCEL

For X11, sets the mouse acceleration. The value should be a string on the form:

"n/d/t"

where n and d are the acceleration numerator/denumerators (so	mouse movement is accelerated by n/d), and t is the threshold above which acceleration applies (counted as number of pixels the mouse moves at once).

125 Hz polling rate is only one poll every 8 ms

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mouse_Polling_Rate

If the polling rate is set at 125 Hz, the mouse cursor can only be updated every 8 milliseconds. In situations where lag is critical (for example games), it is useful to decrease this value to as little as possible. 

" Most all gaming mice will operate at least at 500Hz (2ms) or even 1000Hz (1ms). "

Polling rate	Response time
125 Hz	8 ms
250 Hz	4 ms
500 Hz	2 ms
1000 Hz	1 ms
