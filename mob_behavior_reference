-add term for clustering (nearness to other agents)
-add term for spreading out (swarm behavior)

Squads of robots that roam landscape, looking for players.

Waves of hostile mobs spawn

Squad Behavior:
-squads try to remain spread out (distance from other squad member) but remain within distance of leader

AI faction has a global "alert field" value across the map.  Has exploration state and alert state

Exploration State: measures frequency of visits to area.  Areas with low visit rate have max unknown
- unexplored/unknown
- explored/known

Exploration state is incremented for areas which the AI has spent amounts of time in.  Causes exploration and roaming behavior.

Alert State measures the degree of player sightings within area.  Sightings of enemy units and combat/death increase alert state.

Alert state increases if players are sighted.  Decays over time.  Bayesian parameter.

Implementation:
	-Use a simple 2d field across the map
	-Use simple gaussian increment/decrement of fields

Behavior:
	-AI is attracted to areas of map it has not visited recently.
	-AI is attracted to areas where enemies have been sighted recently.

Movement Decisions:
	-choose destination
	-choose route
