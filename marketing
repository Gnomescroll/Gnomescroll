Campbell> A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.[3]

"Minecraft is certainly a revolutionary game having rocketed the procedurally-generated voxel based world to a place in history. However, it hasn't progressed past its first steps."

People need to understand that Minecraft isn’t a game anymore, it’s a genre. There are so many possibilities with the gameplay mechanics in question that they shouldn’t be limited to a single title. I think a lot of us are waiting for the big names in the industry to pick up on these concepts and start incorporating them in to the new major titles. <-- terraria guy

The visuals and mechanics of procedural generation and terrain deformation of Minecraft were drawn from Infiniminer.[11] According to Minecraft author Markus Persson, after he discovered Infiniminer, he "decided it was the game he wanted to do".[12] As a result, if one plays Infiniminer, one can note that the visuals of blocky graphics and carving out voxel blocks as a miner are practically identical.[13]

As Minecraft became popular, Infiniminer was overshadowed and faded into obscurity. Barth's feelings about Minecraft are complicated. As Minecraft became hugely successful, he stated that he finds it "flattering", "cool" and "awesome", because it was based on something he made.[3]
