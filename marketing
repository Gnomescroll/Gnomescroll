The visuals and mechanics of procedural generation and terrain deformation of Minecraft were drawn from Infiniminer.[11] According to Minecraft author Markus Persson, after he discovered Infiniminer, he "decided it was the game he wanted to do".[12] As a result, if one plays Infiniminer, one can note that the visuals of blocky graphics and carving out voxel blocks as a miner are practically identical.[13]

As Minecraft became popular, Infiniminer was overshadowed and faded into obscurity. Barth's feelings about Minecraft are complicated. As Minecraft became hugely successful, he stated that he finds it "flattering", "cool" and "awesome", because it was based on something he made.[3]
