Crafting:

<HaltingState> minerals, energy, organics (crops seeds, etc..)
<HaltingState> i am trying to figure out how the resource tiers fit together
<HaltingState> for instance
<HaltingState> should crops drop seeds
<HaltingState> or should you have to grind the item back to seeds
<HaltingState> so you have to choose between the crafting item and the seeds to group more crops?
<HaltingState> or should some plants grow seeds and others not
<HaltingState> and "What resources should be required for farming?" for instance a plant might take 4 days to grow, has a moisture level and needs to be watered everyday to keep moisture over 4 or it withers and dies
<HaltingState> but you need water and water is scarce (until you have a portal to organics worlds and can import it)
<HaltingState> some crops mature in 20 minutes but others can take hours and some "epic crops" may take days and require protecting the crop for duration to prevent looting
<HaltingState> crops enable crafting consumables: tier 1 will be like "heal 20 points!" and tier 2 might be  "health regen for 60 seconds"
<HaltingState> and another rare crop might give a potion that increases ore drops by 40% for 5 minutes, but is extremely rare and only grows naturally, etc...
<HaltingState> the crop tiers should go from "Simple and easy" to "ridiculous"
<HaltingState> i am enumerating possibilities, constraints, trade offs; and then implementing simpliest thing for now, keeping in mind where i may want to take it in future

<HaltingState> another thing; another resource
<HaltingState> there is a "nannite" and you feed it and it produces nanites and levels up; you can spend nanites to get certain blocks (Crafting bench etc..) and as it gets higher level you can get more blocks/choices
<HaltingState> which is another progression/resource mechanism
<HaltingState> the blocks you can plant crops on cost nanites and another clan might break into your base and steel crops/hydroponics blocks.. the hydroponics blocks have nanite cost and are therefore scarce etc...
<HaltingState> lots of design issues to balance
<HaltingState> ex. level 3 hydroponics blocks might increase crop yield by 50% and grow crops 50% faster, but consumes energy inputs (requires wire from energy storage to hydroblock); so players have to balance energy used for growing vs energy used for refining resources and crafting etc..

Sand block produces silica
Silica + Coal -> solar cells + CO2
Silica + Hydrogen -> solar cell + H20

Solar Cell used to build solar block
Solar block wired to battery charger to power battery and lights

Blocks need state, need inventory, need timers
Items picked up/dropped off

====
add/remove item from block
add/remove item from inventory
pick up item
drop item
transmute item
