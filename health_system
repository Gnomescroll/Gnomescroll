Health system

Player has Energy
If player takes any damage with Energy 00, he dies. (see: halo 2)
ie his suit / equipment gives him all of his strength

All players have 99 energy default

There are N (4 probably) Reserve Tank slots (see: super metroid. Not the tanks in the top left, but in the pause menu)
When the player's energy reaches 0, and has a Reserve Tank loaded in a slot, the Reserve Tank is consumed and Energy goes to 99

The Reserve Tank slots function the same as any slot, except only reserve tanks allowed.
The player opens the inventory view, and drags a Reserve Tank to each slot.

To indicate that these N slots are for reserve tanks, a greyscale Reserve Tank icon will be drawn in each empty Reserve Tank slot.
Additionally, when a player picks up a reserve tank icon within the inventory GUI, the reserve tank slot region can be highlighted in some way.

The energy status and the reserve tank slots will be rendered above the toolbelt slots. 

If the player has no reserve tanks and takes more damage than energy remaining, his health stops at 00 no matter what.
When energy is 00, and there are no reserve tanks, the text will blink red and white rapidly, to indicate an emergency.

The current sprite for "Repair Kit" would become the "Reserve Tank" sprite.
Cell added a medpack looking sprite, which will be a placeholder for "energy packs". "Energy packs" will function the same as "Repair kits" do now (heal yourself or teammate a small amount)

Energy regen is possible, but an independent mechanism for enabling energy regen does not exist. (Minecraft has full food meter)
Reserve tanks have a bit of cross over with regen.  The mechanisms/pathways for reserve tank acquisition are important.
