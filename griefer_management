dealing with aimbots:
-weekly bans
-public humanilation

<devbug> What you do is:
<devbug> Trust the client
<AttackingHobo> or, I headshoted you with a mele weapon 200 m away
<devbug> Checkk what the client
<devbug> Did, if it is impossible
<devbug> Kill them, ban them, and humiliate them publicly
<devbug> Or save it up and ban people weekly
all use the same hacks
<HaltingState> devbug, public humiliation would be awesome. i should spawn some shit that keeps spawn killing them and make it automaticly upload the video to youtube
<devbug> Did it hit a voxel before it hit the person, or is it imposible to shoot behind you
<devbug> HaltingState: Change their avatar forever
<devbug> To a purple dildo or something
