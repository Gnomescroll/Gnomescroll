Sulake has reported5 that 90% of the Habbo visitors don’t pay. However, this doesn’t
mean that these non-paying visitors are not interested in Habbo furniture. Based on pre-
liminary interviews and fansite stories we had got the impression that it is possible to
have nice rooms and make careers in Habbo without spending money, for instance by
trading or receiving gifts. Our survey showed that a large part of the visitors get furniture
through donations, competitions, or as rewards for favours. Of the 26%6 (2557) who said
that they don’t buy anything, 57% (1451) still receives furniture donations, 48% (1229)
trades furniture, and 31% (782) gets furniture items as pay for “work” in Habbo.
