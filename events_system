EVENTS

Dont do events because we will want to call a lot of these in the die() method
which will delete the object afterward
so we can't just pass in Object* to a generic handler

Chat::object_created(Objects::Object* object);
Chat::object_destroyed(Objects::Object* object);

Sound::object_created(Objects::Object* object);
Sound::object_created(Objects::Object* object, Vec3 position);  // 3d, momentum zero
Sound::object_created(Objects::Object* object, Vec3 position, Vec3 momentum);   // 3d

Sound::object_destroyed(Objects::Object* object);
Sound::object_destroyed(Objects::Object* object, Vec3 position);
Sound::object_destroyed(Objects::Object* object, Vec3 position, Vec3 momentum);

can follow this pattern for more specific events like shot_something, dropped, picked up
