>after executing the mechanic, the player needs to be given a reason to come back

"Unlike single player games, PSW games are never beaten. That is, a player should not reach a state in which the player feels there is no further goal to reach. Instead, the content of the game should be reusable. Since players return to the world often, good game design provides a method of entertainment that does not usually rely on novelty."

"When hundreds to thousands of users simultaneously share a space, they create a virtual society. Because many of the users will be returning and interacting again, then not only is the game persistent, but the social relationships are persistent. Over time these relationships solidify into social organizations, which constitute a society. Whether or not the designers plan on it, this society will be a huge factor in the success or failure of the game."

Because the user' data persists over playing sessions for an indefinite term, playing a PSW game is sometimes compared to an investment. The items and attributes that define the status of the player constitute the player' assets. Accumulating the value of these assets encourages customer renewal, since a strategic player makes a decision to participate based on the expected return on investment (ROI). By exhaustively collecting data on the game and sharing analysis to develop a kind of collective intelligence, the player population can assess the ROI with a fine degree of accuracy.

Asynchronous Interaction
The primary activity on the Internet is e-mail, which is a form of asynchronous communication. PSW games also offer the opportunity for asynchronous interaction. As defined, the game continues while the player is disconnected. Yet, the game may also continue to affect the status of the player while not connected. This can be incorporated as a feature. For example, in Shattered Galaxies, offline player territories may change ownership. In Ultima Online, offline players may sell goods
