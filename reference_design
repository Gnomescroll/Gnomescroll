Design Elements of MMORPGs

"Lesson #1: Polish your newbie content first then ensure the game is fun at every level"

Severely limit vertical character progression. A character should not be inherently more powerful the longer he spends playing the game. A character should be more powerful if the player plans its ability use better or plays the game better.

Death needs to have meaning. The obsession with single-character play has to end. It yields too much investment in one character which leads to severe risk aversion. 

Encourage community-building behavior. Reward players for being in groups, guilds, and factions. Give groups experience bonuses, better item drops, and other perks for participating in the social part of the game. If a game encourages socialization, it more quickly engenders social responsibility in its players—this binds players and keeps them playing the game.

Focus on the player’s in-game experience. If you give the player a rich world, rewarding actions to undertake, and well-constructed game mechanics, your game can still fail. It’s crucial that you present the game to the player with the utmost care. The game has to allow the player to plan and make intelligent decisions: the player must be presented with appropriate information, well laid-out and easy to read and understand.

Accountability System for Dynamic World MMOGs
http://www.thatsaterribleidea.com/2009/11/accountability-system-for-dynamic-world.html

Is it a game?
It's a SERVICE. Not a game. It's a WORLD. Not a game. It's a COMMUNITY. Not a game. Anyone who says, "it's just a game" is missing the point.

Community size
Ideal community size is no larger than 250. Past that, you really get subcommunities.

"Get rid of the Tank, Healer, DPS structure makes about as much sense as removing the grind from MMOs. When its that grind that keeps you playing and that structure that keeps your groups from bursting into flames."

The new players who enter the world for the first time are the best critics of it.

Hate is good. This is because conflict drives the formation of social bonds and thus of communities. It is an engine that brings players closer together.

Ownership is key
You have to give players a sense of ownership in the game. This is what will make them stay--it is a "barrier to departure." Social bonds are not enough, because good social bonds extend outside the game. Instead, it is context. If they can build their own buildings, build a character, own possessions, hold down a job, feel a sense of responsibility to something that cannot be removed from the game--then you have ownership.

Social Infrastructure:
!!!
2 things I would love to see MMOs release with, with the guild tools is – A guild calendar that can be used to arrange events and sign ups for those guild members who do not use forums. And an alliance option where two or more guilds can have an interface to interact. Have a guild window and an alliance window, the alliance window shows all of your guilds alliances…the same chat functions of guild would work for an alliance…someone logs in to the alliance your notified, there’s a global chat for folks, you can see who is logged in to each guild, invite them, and see their zone/level just like a guild interface. It would make arranging things with an alliance force (I’m thinking of small 2 guild alliances as well as huge raid alliances like the CRA on crushbone in eq2) so much easier.
