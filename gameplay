This is another very important skill. Every weapon in System Shock 2, with the exception of the melee weapons and the Psi Amp, has a maintenance level. When a weapons Maintenance level gets to 1, there's a chance with every use that the weapon will break if you use it. Having your gun break in the middle of a fire fight is not fun. Try to get this up to level 4, because at that level you can perform maintenance on every weapon and you'll raise the maintenance level on a weapon by 4 with every use of a maintenance tool, which will save you a lot of money. In addition, the maintenance skill raises the maximum you can charge stuff to, which will help save you trips to the recharge station and back.
