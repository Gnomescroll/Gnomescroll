algae biofarms:
solar panel -> light source
water blcok -> algae block
(water gets greener as it matures)
harvest with rake
algae sepreads to ajacent blocks

-add light
-make maturity speed function of light intensity

there will be lights but they have to either use a battery (runs out and has to be replaced/recharged) or needs wire from solar panels
