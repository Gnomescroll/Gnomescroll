Add explosives/tripwires
Add bots/mobs for building

1> multiple player agents 17:09
2> player agent models (visualization of agents) 17:09
3> collision detection on server 17:09
4> steaming map from server to client (working on right now) 17:10
5> creation of projectiles 17:10
6> add/remove blocks in FPS mode by client


Optimization (LATER):
-fulstrum culling for map chunks
-storing pointers to map tile structs, instead of tile_ids
-computation of vertex buffers in C?
-openGL C rendering
