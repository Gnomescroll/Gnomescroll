1> map scrolling on client
2> ability to send messages to individual clients, instead of to every player connected to game world 
you should add these to issue tracker actually
3> object drawing on client
4> client storage/display of job list
5> (working on now) job creation/deletion API
6> (working on now) agent multistep command API
7> (working on now) interface between atomic agent actions, compound action controller and job manager 
8> (possibly) an html interface for editing tiles/items/crafting stuff/agents (serialize in python dictionaries to disc for now, return dictionaries with get request)
