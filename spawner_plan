Spawner:

Item def,
Sprite
DONE

toolbelt creates spawner

On/off model states
--can we use coloring on existing model?

right click selects spawner
first spawner created by agent is automatically selected
others have to be activated
activating one deactivates others

destroying drop the spawner back

block placement must occlude spawners

networking:
send list of spawners
position,owner

choose_spawner_CtoS
set_active_spawner_StoC

crafting path:
(need more items!!)
4 of each bars: copper, iron, gallium, iridium



============

Need to do toolbelt rewrite, getting out of hand for item action registrations

FUNCTION POINTERS:

Server:
trigger_x(int agent_id, ItemID item_id)
Client:
tick_x(int agent_id, int item_type)
tick_local(ItemID item_id)
trigger_x(int agent_id, int item_type)
trigger_local(ItemID item_id)

Server:
tick -- NOTHING, can be removed
trigger -- adjusts item state, stops fire ticks, callbacks into agent/world
trigger_beta -- same as trigger

auto weapon just dont unset fire_on
get retrigger every N ticks as long as they are on

Client:
tick local -- animations
tick other -- animations

trigger local -- predict durability, local debug/admin actions (requiring no server validation), turn fire off
trigger other -- animaitons, turn fire off

Action events trigger by user input, locally. decides if to send packets: (can be replaced with a lookup for non-null function ptr)
begin_alpha -- begin anims
end_alpha -- end anims
beta -- returns true/false if beta implemented for item/group (needed in new system?No, can just look at functions implemented)

TODO
handle wrapping completely -- guaranteed turn on/off shit
turn on/off methods for server

get_trigger_local_item() functions in client

REMAINING:
Replace tick/trigger fn entry points
Reimplement all callbacks
Debug

REMAINING FINAL
durability & stack not decrementing
