"In Minecraft 1.7, do I now have to kill sheep to collect wool?" we need mobs that drop crafting reagents

Need wandering NPCs with trade menus

<dillbillz> If you paid $X dollars to the server you get [VIP] tag, VIP status and VIP bonuses for Y months

<HaltingState> o0o0 this res system mod is cool; you can rent out house
<-- guards for fee, then player rents out houses

<dillbillz> A bounty system where you can put a bounty on someones head, and then reward the killer with synth chips or something else automatically when they kill them
<dillbillz> like /bounty kaprekar 100
<Kaprekar> ahhh
<dillbillz> and when someone kills kap they automatically get credited 100 of my synthchips

<Kaprekar> flags/emblems for clans
<Kaprekar> an emblem would appear on the members of a clan (toggleable by players)

In order to mix a potion, you will need at least a Mortar and Pestle, and two ingredients which share at least 1 effect. You can use up to four ingredients in a potion. Any effects shared by two or more of these ingredients will be applied to the potion. 

for a minecraft game the relevent effects are: 
"see in dark/night vision" 
"increased luck" <-- more drops when mining
"inceased health regen"
"increased mele damage"
"resist damage"
"increase speed"
"detect chests"
"detect players/animals"

>Skill Based:
At first, you will only be able to see one or two effects listed in the stats of any given ingredient, depending on your starting skill. Each ingredient can have up to four effects. (See the charts listed in the links below for more specific information.) The number of effects you can see will depend on your skill, based on the following values:

move it up until it can walk forward :-\

Todo: Add gas compressor
Add Iron Ore
Add Copper Ore
Add Silica
Add Lithium

silica + energy = quartz crystal (oven)
silica = silicon crystal (oven)
silicon crystal + copper = solar mesh (crafting)
silicon crystal + 2x copper wire = solar mesh (crafting)

copper = 4x wires (crafting)
copper + lithium = storage cell

Solar Mesh
    silicon crystal + copper = solar mesh
    silicon crystal + 2x copper wire = solar mesh
Battery unit
    copper + lithium = battery unit
    2x copper wire + lithium = battery unit
Quartz Laser Cystal
    quartz + energy cystral
Mining Laser:
    Iron + battery unit + quartz laser crystal 
    (base material gives durability multiplier?)
    Iron + battery unit + ruby laser crystal
Storage Unit:
    4x iron = storage unit

4x steel = gas compressor
1x steel = steel cylinder
steel cylinder + methane (compressor) -> gas cylinder

Jet Pack:
    iron + gas cylinder + battery unit

Steel -> 4x Steel Rod
Steel -> 2x Steel Piston

Cyro Freezer:
    Steel + Steel Rod + Steel Piston + copper = Cryo freezer
    Steel + Steel Rod + Steel Piston + 2x copper wire = Cryo freezer

Gas Compressor:
    Steel + Steel Rod + Steel Piston + copper = Gas compressor
    Steel + Steel Rod + Steel Piston + 2x copper wire = Gas compressor

etc...
silicon + alien artifact = CPU core


Energy:
    - energy mesh (goes over block, generates electricity in day light)
    - wires (copper)
    - energy collector (sits on ground, pedistool, grows energy crystals for collection)
    - better collectors yields larger energy cystals?  More collectors on face yields larger cystrals?

!!! 
Implement jetpacks ASAP
    - dash is shift
    - vertical jetpack is z
    - recharge bar


Methane Hydrate Ice Storms:
    - ambient weather conditions
    - like snow in minecraft
    - coat surface with a thin block with low friction during storm

!!! Health Must Regen if conditions are met (hunger)
    - prolong combat
    - allow players to remove self from danger

Alchemy System:
    - morrowind style
    - each reagant has 1 to 3 attributes from level 1 to 3
    - 1 to 3 reagants can be combined to produce a potion
    - potion attribute is additive in reagents and increases if all potions have attribute
    - potions stack if they have the same attributes

Procedural Plants:
    - vines
    - fruit
    - allow to cross over and colonize multiple blocks

Gas Canisters:
    - color orb based upon type of gas
    - has a level of gas, which depletes and gas canister becomes empty
    - is filled by compressing gas cystals
    - 
!!! Environment

Social:
    -?personal worlds for item storage etc?
    - clan access
    - access lists
    - beacons (recall points)

Solid, transparent blocks (liquid methane).  Like water but solid.  Lakes cover surface.
    -attenuates light by 3 per block   
    -may flow like liquid (but extremely slowly)
    -drops frozen crystals (which decay over time)
    -item decay is constant probability to decrement stack every n ticks (large stacks last longer)
    -item decay can be stopped (correction: slowed) by storing item in cryo-freezer
    - methane + gas canister + energy -> hydrogen gas canister + carbon (resource value)
    - 

Blueprints !!!
Crafting Blue Prints have Parts
User must collect n parts to make crafting blueprint
!!! Collection/Trade

!!! Survival Games Are Popular
ArmA 2 - DayZ <-- pushed Arma 2 back to top of steam

-mining robots (dig mine shafts, collect minerals, build robots to attack player, territorial)

!!! Personal Spawner
-one use item, returns player to spawner on death (like check point)

Noise is a mapping from Rn to R - you input an n-dimensional point with real coordinates, and it returns a real value. Currently the most common uses are for n=1, n=2, and n=3. The first is used for animation, the second for cheap texture hacks, and the third for less-cheap texture hacks. Noise over R4 is also very useful for time-varying solid textures, as I'll show later.

A 3d space, created from slive of 4d perlin, that changes over time.  Constantly shifting.  Blocks are added and removed at boundries (probability of erosion at surface based upon function).  Nothing permament.  Constantly shifting.

In Star Wars Galaxies, surveyors locate deposits of chemicals and minerals across different planets. To harvest these resources in bulk, surveyors must purchase mining installations from architects.
Alternatively, surveyors can choose to sell the locations of rich deposits (i.e. the information itself) to miners rather than harvesting the resources themselves. Surveyors who choose to harvest resources may then become resource brokers who market those resources to artisans and manufacturers who need those resources to produce goods. Combat, medical or fashion goods then are sold on the open market and bought by mercenaries, doctors and other members of the general public.

!!! Add "prospecting skill" for finding minerals

!!!
Better noise functions:

> Noise is band-limited - almost all of its energy (when looked at as a signal) is concentrated in a small part of the frequency spectrum. High frequencies (visually small details) and low frequencies (large shapes) contribute very little energy. Its appearance is similar to what you'd get if you took a big block of random values and blurred it (ie: convolved with a gaussian kernel). Although that would be quite expensive to compute.

Use random values and vary kernel to control noise

Add Riot Shields!!

Handling Death Sequence:
Less common are feedback systems that inform players about their improvement at the game. One great example happens in Team Fortress 2. When players die, a message informs them about how they did relative to previous attempts, for example: "On the bright side... You came close to your record for time alive as a Scout in that round." The message goes on to indicate how long the player lived that round and what his previous personal best was. This is excellent feedback.
