!!! Environment

Solid, transparent blocks (liquid methane).  Like water but solid.  Lakes cover surface.
    -attenuates light by 3 per block   
    -may flow like liquid (but extremely slowly)
    -drops frozen crystals (which decay over time)
    -item decay is constant probability to decrement stack every n ticks (large stacks last longer)
    -item decay can be stopped by storing item in cryo-freezer



-mining robots (dig mine shafts, collect minerals, build robots to attack player, territorial)

!!! Personal Spawner
-one use item, returns player to spawner on death (like check point)

Noise is a mapping from Rn to R - you input an n-dimensional point with real coordinates, and it returns a real value. Currently the most common uses are for n=1, n=2, and n=3. The first is used for animation, the second for cheap texture hacks, and the third for less-cheap texture hacks. Noise over R4 is also very useful for time-varying solid textures, as I'll show later.

A 3d space, created from slive of 4d perlin, that changes over time.  Constantly shifting.  Blocks are added and removed at boundries (probability of erosion at surface based upon function).  Nothing permament.  Constantly shifting.

In Star Wars Galaxies, surveyors locate deposits of chemicals and minerals across different planets. To harvest these resources in bulk, surveyors must purchase mining installations from architects.
Alternatively, surveyors can choose to sell the locations of rich deposits (i.e. the information itself) to miners rather than harvesting the resources themselves. Surveyors who choose to harvest resources may then become resource brokers who market those resources to artisans and manufacturers who need those resources to produce goods. Combat, medical or fashion goods then are sold on the open market and bought by mercenaries, doctors and other members of the general public.

!!! Add "prospecting skill" for finding minerals

Better noise functions:

> Noise is band-limited - almost all of its energy (when looked at as a signal) is concentrated in a small part of the frequency spectrum. High frequencies (visually small details) and low frequencies (large shapes) contribute very little energy. Its appearance is similar to what you'd get if you took a big block of random values and blurred it (ie: convolved with a gaussian kernel). Although that would be quite expensive to compute.

Use random values and vary kernel to control noise

Handling Death Sequence:
Less common are feedback systems that inform players about their improvement at the game. One great example happens in Team Fortress 2. When players die, a message informs them about how they did relative to previous attempts, for example: "On the bright side... You came close to your record for time alive as a Scout in that round." The message goes on to indicate how long the player lived that round and what his previous personal best was. This is excellent feedback.
