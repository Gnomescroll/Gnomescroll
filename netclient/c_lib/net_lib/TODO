-early event/control state change detection (200-500 hz polling rate)

-event driven server updates (process moves/firing as they come in)
-only adjust xangle 5-10 times per second
-use flags instead of message ids for common messages

-test delaying firing by 1-2 ticks to compensate for latency
-jitter buffer
