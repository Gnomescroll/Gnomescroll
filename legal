In every game I've modded so far, the EULA for the game insisted that any derivative works were owned by the development company. I've even seen it enforced. Civilization 4's expansion, Beyond the Sword, included PLAYER-MADE mods, and the modders were not compensated for it. (Beyond a free copy of the expansion). I see no reason why the same would be different here. I think the idea of charging for mods is ridiculous.
