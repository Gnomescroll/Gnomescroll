ENTITY MIGRATION TODO

eliminate subtypes
DONE
rename Object_types to ObjectType
DONE

move all network packets to entity/network
DONE
rewrite handlers to match new system
DONE --but need to enable owner/team stuff once those components are defined

migrate objects one per type to objects/
migrate components as needed
gather object data from various switches
test after each

TODO:

network components MOVED
--wire existing objects

team    DONE
owner   DONE

changed state DONE

voxel_model DONE (partly, should integrate the updates onto the component)

explosion component DONE
animation   --wait
agent spawner DONE
monster spawner DONE
dimension (height, camera_height) DONE
targeting   DONE

turret
spawner -- need to merge spawner list crap somewhere
box
slime
monster spawner
gems    DONE

attach network interfaces
fill in data

move components lists out

Save this stuff from objects.old:
common/api/*

REMAINING:
animation component
rate limited network updates
events (chat, sound, shot)
item drop component -- or at least a file with those configs
spawned_by/parent/child component
traveling component
put more shit on targeting component (from box)
move to target component?
proximity component? merge with targeting?

==============
TODO in the morning:

fix turret attacking
    -- need to abstract those turret_shot functions
make component for target box motion
spawned/child component

item drops
rate limited packet interface?, like the rest of the packet interfaces
--has state, needs to be allocated like a component anyway

==============
event queue?
    -- reduces workload for chat,sound,animation triggers
    -- especially those switched in packet handlers routing object shot object
    ---- this might be solved now with entity system
==============

Future optimizations:

preallocate objects
--definitely faster; eliminates malloc of component array, nothing else different

preallocate components -- load data from default model
--not sure if faster than new, but probably is. depends on how much faster malloc loading defaults is

use swaps on lists
--minimize/eliminate iterating whole list

static component lookup array per type
--eliminates pointer dereferences required for finding component

static has_tick has_update per type
--avoids iterating entire batches of objects that will all be null in tick() or update()
