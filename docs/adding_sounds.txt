Open design_spreadsheet.ods
Switch to tab 2, labelled "Sounds"

This spreadsheet has the following columns:
Event -- name of event
Soundfile -- filename of sound to play for event, in ./media/sound/wav/. If the file does not exist or contains invalid filename characters, there will be problems (most likely crash)
function name -- name of the function in code -- dont edit
Desired sound effect description -- notes on what the event should/might sound like
IN USE - documents whether it is being used in code -- dont edit, its redundant now and was a note for the code
Integrated -- specifies whether the function handler is being called for the event, in the code. if it isnt integrated, no sound will play
Notes -- misc


The only columns you should edit are:
Soundfile
desired sound effect descriptions
Notes

You can also add more entries if you think of a new event that should have sound


TO TEST SOUNDFILE CHANGES:
you've edited a soundfile cell to use a new sound
find the "export" or "save as" function in your software ("save as" in gnumeric)
export/saveas sounds.csv
put sounds.csv in ./netclient/media/sound/
Start client


IF PROBLEMS OCCUR:
The client will print the sound triggers it is assigned, function name -> soundfile.
If these are not as you expect (they should match the csv file, and no empty names),
the problem may be with the csv file, and you might be able to fix it.

Make sure the all the requested soundfiles exist in the ./netclient/media/sound/wav/ folder

Otherwise, save the csv for me, (rename it sounds.csv.failure1 or whatever, and commit to repo, or just send it to me)
and I will test it. We shouldnt run into bugs more than twice, if any


======================
Notes:
Make sure there are no newlines (\n) in spreadsheet cells. this fucks up the csv and thus fucks up the parser


max distance is AL_MAX_DISTANCE which is the distance at which attenuation stops being applied if using the inverse distance clamped model (which we are)
suppose AL_MAX_DISTANCE is 10; all points >10 units away will play a 3d sound at the same volume, the volume that it is at 10.
This is NOT the max distance at which the sound will play (which we want more often in my experience)
The column "max playable distance" is a hard cutoff; any sounds outside this range will not play
Currently (aug18,2012) there is no support for a player moving close enough to hear a playing sound, but was not close enough when the sound started
This doesnt really matter unless you have some looping environment 3d sound (which we dont at the time of this writing)

use this graph tool get get parameters for 3d sounds
in the sheet, D is reference distance, O is rolloff factor, E is AL_MAX_DISTANCE
read the openal programmers guide for more information
the attenuation model is INVERSE_DISTANCE_CLAMPED
