==Debugging==

There are two important tools for debugging, gdb and valgrind.
Valgrind is not available on windows.

=Installation=

For linux, use the package manager.
For OSX, use brew.  However, recently valgrind has had a problem with running on osx.
If you have trouble, ask rdn/steve about it, there is a patch.
