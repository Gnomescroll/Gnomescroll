=============== HOW TO ADD EQUIPMENT ======================

1. Create an item with group IG_EQUIPMENT and a valid EquipmentType
2. Compile & run


==================== EXAMPLE ==============================

item_def(IG_EQUIPMENT, "iron_helmet");
s->equipment_type = EQUIPMENT_TYPE_HEAD;


=============== WHAT IS EQUIPMENT? ========================

Equipment is an item that can be "worn" by the player.
The equipment will change the player's model and give them benefits of some kind.

Equipment is not to be confused with items in your toolbelt.

Available equipment types are in item/common/enum.hpp


===================== RULES ==============================

IG_EQUIPMENT items should have a max_stack_size of 1 (the default -- you don't need to change anything)
and max_charges of NULL_CHARGES (also the default)

IG_EQUIPMENT items must have a valid equipment_type defined


============= EQUIPMENT_TYPE_ACCESSORY ===================
    These are generic accessories that would be rings & amulets in other games (WoW)
    But they are not limited to simple bonuses.
    They could be anything "equippable"/worn to the player that does not fit
    in the existing body part categories
    (head/body/feet/hands at the time of this writing)

    Examples:
        An infrared visor
        A shoulder-mounted light
