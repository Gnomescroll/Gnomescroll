hitscan

Client fires weapon
Client calculates trajectory / intersection w/ another agent/block
Send 'fire' message (requires server to know which direction players are facing)
	: tick #
	: hitting what if anything, and where

Server gets message
Relay fire message to all other clients, they will simulate the trajectory, do sound /animation
If message hitting anything, Server calculates trajectory / intersection
If the game state at this frame is not expired,
	the trajectory calculation appears valid,
	the agent's active weapon has ammo
Calculate block/agent damage, send status update to clients (play blood/rock animation, sound; play kill sound if dead)
Update should include:
	agent id
	tick #, or the frame state for the agent at the time (if clients are not keeping tick history)
Clients should know which weapon that agent had, they can simulate the bullet/explosion

::
Requires server to know which direction players are facing (need for displaying agents properly in clients anyway)
Requires server maintaining a list of past ticks, for some N ticks
