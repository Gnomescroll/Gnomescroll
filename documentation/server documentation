Redis:

Redis mediates communication between servers.
HTML Client sends JSON messages through post method, received by html_server/server.py
html_server/server.py communicates with game_server/server.py through redis.
game_server/server.py communicates to node_server/server.js through redis.
node_server/server.js relays messsages back to client through socket.io

Static content server:

./html_server/static_server.py serves static content and will be replaced by apache someday.
