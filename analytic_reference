>  Cousins dug deeper and found that only 20 percent of players had ever visited the forums and that only 2 percent had ever actually posted a message

>  compared with the silent majority, community members had a much higher conversion rate (27 percent vs. 2 percent) and ARPPU ($110 vs. $32). 

> These players had a history of being reliable sources of information during the post-release development of Civ III, and we provided them with a special, private forum for direct communication with the team. 

>  These groups must be managed carefully, however, to prevent the members from developing a sense of entitlement or superiority over other players. For this reason, the group's existence should be, if possible, a closely guarded secret.

> Another accurate way to gather feedback is with "Kleenex" testing, so named because players get access to the pre-release game once and are then thrown away. The valuable lessons here come from players' initial reactions to the game, before they become accustomed to UI holes or gameplay quirks. Valve famously runs these tests regularly by gathering up random players from local game stores.
